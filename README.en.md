# **Il tempo Consuma**
Bachelor Thesis project, in collaboration with Padua's University research center _Centro di Sonologia Computazionale_ (CSC), to transfer the multimedia performance _Il tempo consuma_ by Michele Sambin in the digital domain.

## Abstract

In this paper we present the steps and tools used for the transferring
into the digital domain of the multimedia live performance Il Tempo Consuma
by Michele Sambin.
The role of technology in the development of the original performance, dating back to 1978, as well as the artistic and technical research for the realization of the videoloop are discussed.
Then the paper focuses to the analysis of the elements that make up the system of digital processing developed in order to recovery the original work. At first the hardware components are intronduced. Subsequently moving on the custom-developed software components realized through Max/MSP, an object-oriented graphic development environment
used for the creation of applications of musical and multimedia processing.
After a brief introduction to the language, will be discussed in detail the components that have allowed the creation of the software used for reproduction.
The objects necessary for video processing are then analyzed
through the use of Jitter components, the objects used for audio processing through MSP, and finally the interface implemented thanks to the OSC language for controlling some parameters of the project through an external controller.
